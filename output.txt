segments. Segment results that are reported to the CEO include costs directly attributable to a segment as
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly head office
expenses.
Segment information is presented in the financial statements in respect of the Group’s contribution
segments which are the primary basis of decision making. The contribution segment reporting format
reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Performance is measured based on contribution which is a measure of profitability that the segment
contributes to the Group. Contribution is used to measure performance as management believes that
such information is most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments. Inter-segment pricing is
determined on an arms-length basis.

02. REVENUE
The Group generates revenue primarily from the sale of Mānuka honey, other bee products, and olive leaf
products to its customers (wholesale, retail and digital customers). Sales of products are recognised when
control of the goods has transferred to the customer, usually when the goods are delivered. For wholesale
sales, control passes according to individual contract terms.
All sales are net of returns and allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates.

Government grants primarily relate to the New Zealand Research and Development Tax Incentive scheme
(RDTI), but also includes other government grants. The RDTI scheme provides a tax credit on eligible R&D
expenditure. The RDTI scheme includes both core R&D expenditure, as well as other expenses that support
R&D, and is recorded as non-taxable income.
Insurance Cyclone Gabrielle
In February 2023, the Group’s Hawkes Bay facility suffered extensive damage due to Cyclone Gabrielle,
a catastrophic weather event in the North Island of New Zealand. Further details of the impacts of this
weather event are disclosed in the 2023 financial statements.
Included in insurance proceeds received above is NZD 1,700,000 relating to our business interruption and
material damage policy in relation to the cyclone. At reporting date there is NZD 828,000 (2023: NZD
5,480,000) of insurance proceeds receivable (note 17) and the insurance claim is ongoing.
Insurance proceeds are recognized in the financial statements when it is virtually certain that the Group will
receive the reimbursement and the amount can be reliably estimated. The recognition is based on the net
realizable value of the claim, considering any deductibles, policy exclusions, and other recoveries expected.
Insurance proceeds receivable are recorded under sundry receivables in the statement of financial position
(note 17).

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
periods.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be
realised.

19. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued)
Depreciation
Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is allocated to
cost of sales, marketing expenses, selling and distribution expenses, and administrative and other operating
expenses.
The estimated useful life for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Buildings up to 50 years
• Plant and machinery 2 - 20 years
• Vehicles 4 - 15 years
• Office equipment, furniture and fittings 2 - 15 years
• Bearer plants 20 - 100 years
• Mānuka Forest 15 - 22 years
Depreciation methods, useful life and residual values are reassessed at the reporting date.
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing
the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the
functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount
of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the
Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and
equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.

21. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. Amortisation is
allocated to cost of sales, marketing expenses, selling and distribution expenses, and administrative and
other operating expenses.
The estimated useful life for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Intellectual property and other intangible assets 3 – 20 years
• Capitalised development costs 2 – 5 years
• Software 2 - 10 years
The estimation of useful lives of intangible assets such as distribution networks have been based on
historical experience. The useful lives are reviewed at least once per year and adjustments to useful lives are
made when considered necessary.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill
and brands, is recognised in the income statement when incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and other business combinations is presented within
intangible assets. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Impairment expense summary
During the period, the Group identified impairments related to financial assets. Subsequent to this, given
the identification of impairment indicators, the Group has undertaken an assessment of the carrying
value of its CGUs and non-financial assets. This assessment was supported by an independent valuation
completed in accordance with Advisory Engagement Standard 2. As a result of this assessment, various
impairments have been recognised and are summarised as follows:

Software
A software impairment of $5,752,000 has been recognised as the software will no longer be utilised or
provide economic benefits as a result of transformation in the digital market.
Greater China and South East Asia CGUs
The Greater China and South East Asia CGUs have been impacted by a down-turn in consumer demand
in Asian markets, particularly China, that is expected to result in a period of low growth and increased
pressure to grow sales volume. This has resulted in a goodwill impairment of $25,632,000 and $4,699,000
respectively. In addition, the China distribution network asset of $5,016,000 has been impaired to nil.
Apiary CGU
There is currently excess supply over demand for Mānuka Honey, which has put downwards process on
Mānuka Honey pricing. This has impacted the revenue stream for this CGU in the short term and resulted in
a goodwill impairment of $1,766,000, a plant & machinery impairment of $900,000 and a Mānuka Forest
asset impairment of $2,500,000.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs which represent the lowest level
within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The aggregate carrying
amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are as follows:

A Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that
are largely independent from other assets and groups. Impairment reviews are performed by management
annually to assess the carrying values of the CGUs containing goodwill. The recoverable amount of a CGU is
determined based on value in use calculations. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows
for a five-year period are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflect current
market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to that asset. An impairment is recognised
when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.

Biological assets comprise bees and olive leaf, and are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Fair value of
biological assets is determined annually and is recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of bees is determined by reviewing the operational hives in use as well as ensuring the value per
hive is in line with guidance provided by the Ministry of Primary Industries (a level 2 valuation). The fair value
of olive leaf is determined using input costs (a level 3 valuation). The Group is exposed to some risks related
to owning bees and olive leaf, primarily the risk of damage from climatic changes and diseases. The Group
has processes in place aimed at monitoring and mitigating those risks.
Olive leaf is transferred from biological asset to inventory at fair value at the date of harvest.

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to
the net assets of the arrangements, rather than the rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but it does not have control or
joint control over the financial and operating policies. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using
the equity method (equity accounted investments). The income statement includes the Group’s share of the
income and expenses of equity accounted investments.
An assessment of the carrying value of equity accounted investments is performed at least annually and
considers objective evidence for impairment on each investment. Objective evidence includes observable
data on the investment, the status or context of markets, management’s own view of fair value, and
long-term investment intentions. The assessment also requires judgements about the expected future
performance and cash flows of the investment.

a) Apiter
In January 2023, Comvita agreed to supply additional funding to Apiter in exchange for an increase in
ownership from 20% holding to 32% holding. The additional funding was completed in two phases: an initial
loan of USD 545,000 in January 2023 and an additional USD 1,445,000 when the share issuance procedures
were completed in Uruguay, at which point the initial loan converted to equity. On 19 October 2023, the
share issuance procedures and additional funding phase was completed.
An impairment of $7,918,000 has been recognised related to the Apiter investment, reducing the carrying
value to nil at 30 June 2024. In addition, an impairment expense of $1,259,000 has been recognised against
the loan to Apiter, reducing the carrying value to nil. This investment has been impacted by South America
geopolitical unrest and persistent high inflation which has impacted Government spending and Apiter
revenue growth strategies.
b) Makino
On 20 June 2024, Comvita sold its share in the Makino joint venture to the other shareholder of Makino
(the purchaser). As part of the transaction the loan to Makino was assigned to the Purchaser. A gain on
disposal of $1,377,000 was recognised in other income (note 3).
c) Caravan Honey
An impairment of $4,251,000 has been recognised related to the Caravan Honey investment, reducing
the carrying value to nil at 30 June 2024. This investment is still in the development stage and will require
further investment to launch commercially. Due to uncertainty of securing future funding, this investment
has been impaired.

25. BUSINESS COMBINATION
Acquisition of the assets of Swift Health Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd
Acquired entity
On 5 July 2023, Comvita Singapore Pte Ltd, (a subsidiary of Comvita Limited), acquired the assets of Swift
Health Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the Acquired Business”), a specialised honey retail business located in
Singapore, trading as HoneyWorld. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3,
Business Combinations in the year ended 30 June 2024.
Purchase consideration
The acquisition was made in exchange for the following consideration:
In thousands of New Zealand dollars
Initial cash payment 7,294
Deferred amounts payable 3,011
Fair value of contingent consideration 1,868
12,173
Fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been finalised based on
independent valuation and other relevant information available:
In thousands of New Zealand dollars

Intangible asset – restraint of trade 168
Property, plant and equipment 34
Deferred tax asset 708
Employee liabilities (53)
Customer loyalty scheme (53)
Add: goodwill (note 21) 4,672
Net assets acquired 12,173
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable
assets acquired. The goodwill is attributable to the workforce, supplier relationships and the profitability of
the acquired business. The goodwill acquired is not deductible for tax purposes.
Contingent consideration (significant estimate)
NZD 1,868,000 of contingent consideration was based on the achievement of specific performance targets
and was payable in 2024 and 2025, split evenly over two years.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated by calculating the present value of the future
expected cash flows. The estimates are based on a probability adjusted discount rate of 19.3%.
As at 30 June 2024 the contingent consideration payable at 30 June 2024 has been derecognised, as
the criteria was not met. A gain of NZD 1,020,000 was included in other income (note 3). The contingent
consideration payable as at 30 June 2025 has been revalued at 30 June 2024 and the difference in fair
value of NZD 164,000 has been recognized as a change of fair value of contingent consideration in other
expenses (note 5).
Revenue and profit contribution
The Acquired Business contributed revenues of NZD 12,818,000 and a loss of NZD 77,000 to the Group
for the period from 5 July 2023 to 30 June 2024.

FINANCIAL RISKS
The Group is exposed to market, liquidity, and credit risks. The Group’s financial risk management system
mitigates exposure to these risks by ensuring that material risks are identified, the financial impact is
understood, and tools and limits are in place to manage exposures. Written policies provide the framework
for the Group’s financial risk management system.
26. MARKET RISK
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates through its receipts and payments that are
denominated in a currency other than the New Zealand Dollar. The currencies in which transactions are
primarily denominated are Chinese Yuan, United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars,
Japanese Yen, Euros, and British Pounds.
The Group manages this risk using a mix of forward foreign exchange contracts, collars and options to fix
future cash flow receipts in New Zealand dollars. At any point in time the Group hedges between 40% to
100% of its estimated net foreign currency receipts expected to be received over the following 12 months,
and between 0% to 50% in respect of 12-to-24-month net foreign currency receipts.
As at reporting date the Group had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding:
In thousands of New Zealand dollars 30 June 2024 30 June 2023

Interest rate risk
The Group has fixed and floating rate debt and is exposed to movements in interest rates. For fixed rate
debt the exposure is to falling interest rates as the Group could have secured that debt at lower rates, while
for floating rate debt there is uncertainty of future cash interest payments.

Docusign Envelope ID: 2DF6B950-B7E9-45D2-904B-A709E13C86A0
2024
26. MARKET RISK (continued)
The Group manages these risks using interest rate swaps to ensure that the total debt portfolio has an
appropriate amount of fixed and floating rate exposure. The risk is monitored by assessing the notional
amount of debt on a fixed and floating basis and ensuring this is in accordance with set policies.
As at the reporting date, the Group had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding:
In thousands of New Zealand dollars 30 June 2024 30 June 2023
Interest rate swaps asset/(liability) - 48
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the
Group’s earnings. Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates will have an impact
on profit. At 30 June 2024 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates
would decrease the Group’s profit before income tax by approximately $963,000 (30 June 2023: $778,000).
27. LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient liquid assets to pay the Group's debts as they fall due. The
Group manages the risk by monitoring forecast cash flows and holding sufficient undrawn bank facilities to
meet the Group's needs.
The contractual maturity of the Group's funding is as follows:

28. CREDIT RISK
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by its trade debtors and banking counterparties
in the normal course of business. To minimise credit risk exposure, the Group reviews each new customer
for credit worthiness and investments and derivatives are only entered into with reputable institutions. At
balance date, the Group’s bank accounts were held with banks with acceptable credit ratings determined
by recognised credit agencies. The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to subsidiaries and
equity accounted investees.
The majority of revenue is generated from retailers and consumers and there is some geographical
concentration of credit risk in China. In order to determine which customers are classified as having payment
difficulties, the Group applies a mix of duration and frequency of default. Aging trade receivables are
reviewed monthly by management.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was:
In thousands of New Zealand dollars 30 June 2024 30 June 2023
Australia 4,457 6,015
China 15,315 13,366

Hong Kong 554 668
South East Asia 2,626 -
Other regions 1,621 2,952
Total 35,030 39,373
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method and adjusted for credit impairment losses.
The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade
receivables. The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. In assessing credit losses on trade
receivables the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative inputs. Quantitative data includes past
collection rates, industry statistics, ageing of receivables, and trading outlook. Qualitative inputs include
past trading history with the Group.

29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities into two categories:
• those to be measured at amortised cost
• t hose to be measured a fair value (either through profit and loss (FVPL) or through comprehensive
income (FVOCI)
Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables,
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at FVPL,
any directly attributable transaction costs. A financial instrument is recognised if the Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial
asset to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
Non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus directly attributable
transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost and subject to regular review for
impairment.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate
risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
immediately. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value in
the balance sheet. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income
statement.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the hedging reserve to the extent that
the hedge is effective.
The derivative financial instruments have been valued using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology.
All financial instruments held by the Group and measured at fair value are classified as level 2 under the fair
value measurement hierarchy.

30. SHARE SCHEMES
Leader Share Purchase & Loan Scheme
In 2021 Comvita Limited established a Leader Share Purchase & Loan Scheme (“LSPLS”) to retain key
employees and materially align the interests of participants with those of shareholders, by making loans
available to eligible employees for the acquisition of fully paid ordinary shares in Comvita.

Performance Share Rights Scheme
Comvita Limited has a Performance Share Rights (PSR’s) Scheme to incentivise Executives. Upon vesting
of the PSR’s, shares will be transferred from treasury stock or new shares will be issued in the capital of the
Company on the terms and conditions described in the Comvita Limited Performance Share Rights Scheme.
Share based payment expenses are recognised over the vesting period of these PSR's.

Employee Share Scheme
In 2022 the Company established a new Employee Share Scheme called the Comvita Exempt Employee
Share Scheme (“CEES Scheme"). The CEES Scheme is designed to allow employees to share in the future of
the Company. The key points of the CEES Scheme are:
• Comvita offered a certain number of ordinary shares to eligible employees.
• When the offer was accepted Comvita issued the shares to the CEES Scheme Trustee (Comvita Share
Scheme Trustee Limited, which is a subsidiary Company) who will hold the shares on the employee’s
behalf.
• The release of shares to the employee is subject to remaining employed with the Company for three
consecutive years subsequent to accepting the offer.
• The Company may from time to time invite eligible employees to participate in the CEES Scheme.
• All dividends or other distributions made in respect of each employee's shares held on trust by the Trustee
shall be paid to the employee.
There are 150 employees in the CEES Scheme and the number of shares held is 56,385.
Share-based payment transactions
A valuation of each employee scheme is performed at grant date either using the Monte Carlo model or
the share price at grant date, less the present value of estimated dividend payments during the period.
A share based payment is recognised over the vesting period of the PSR as an employee expense, with a
corresponding increase in equity. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual
number of share entitlements that vest.

Responsibilities of directors for the consolidated financial
statements
The directors, on behalf of the Group, are responsible for:
— the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ
IFRS issued by the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board;
— implementing the necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a consolidated set of financial
statements that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
— assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. This includes disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated
financial statements
Our objective is:
— to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
— to issue an independent auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs NZ will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
consolidated financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located at the
External Reporting Board (XRB) website at:
